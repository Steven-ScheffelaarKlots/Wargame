- This should be a scoreboard application, ideally created to score the 10th edition of Warhammer 40k using the latest rules
- The scoreboard will need to keep track of only 2 players at a time, no more, no less
    - Should ask for the the users name and the opponents name
    - Should ask what faction they are playing, and give choices of what armies they are playing
- It should help you plan out the setup of the game, by helping choose one of the premade Games Workshop 10th edition games
    - Shuold let users choose one of the different recommended terrain layouts for the deployment

- After the game is setup, and the player who is going first is chosen, it should display the score of the player going first, and then the score of the player going second
    - The scoreboard should keep track of the 5 turns of the game seperately, but should be open to be configured later to do more or less than 5 turns
    - Should let users choose random secondaries from the current 10th edtion secondary rules, they should have 2 active secondaries at a time
        - Should have a shorthand to let the users know what they are scoring, but should be expandable if they want to see the full rules test of a secondary objective
        - There should be an option for the user to get rid of a secondary in their command phase, and an option for the user to get rid of one at the end of their turn. If they do not score the secondary, or get rid of it, the secondary will continue to exist for the player's next turn
